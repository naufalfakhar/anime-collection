# A note for the reviewer

Dear reviewer,

I am writing this note to express my sincere appreciation for the time and effort you put into reviewing my technical test. I understand the crucial role you play as a reviewer in assessing candidates' skills and potential, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have my abilities evaluated.

First and foremost, I want to thank you for giving me the chance to demonstrate my technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities. After I submitted the test, I spend my time to fix some code and build better UI. If you would like to see an improved version of the code and UI, I invite you to check out the ["refactored" branch](https://github.com/naufalfakhar/anime-collection/tree/refactored) and [deployed refactored branch](https://anime-collection-git-refactored-naufalfakhar.vercel.app/).

Thank you once again for your time, consideration, and the opportunity to showcase my skills. I eagerly await your response and feedback.

Best regards, Ahmad Naufal Alfakhar
