# A note for the reviewer

Dear reviewer,

I am writing this note on July 2nd, 2023, to express my sincere appreciation for the time and effort you put into reviewing my technical test. I understand the crucial role you play as a reviewer in assessing candidates' skills and potential, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have my abilities evaluated.

First and foremost, I want to thank you for giving me the chance to demonstrate my technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities. I received the technical test invitation on June 24th, 2023, with a 7-day deadline, which coincided perfectly with the Eid holiday. However, I unfortunately fell ill during this time. Please understand that I don't intend to make excuses, but I wanted to provide some context. Despite not feeling well, I accepted the challenge and submitted my work on June 30th. If you would like to see an improved version of the code and UI, I invite you to check out the "refactored" branch and [deployed refactored branch](https://anime-collection-git-refactored-naufalfakhar.vercel.app/).

Thank you once again for your time, consideration, and the opportunity to showcase my skills. I eagerly await your response and feedback.

Best regards, Ahmad Naufal Alfakhar
